# Interest-Rate-Forecasting

This repository is dedicated to interest rate forecasting, utilizing models from mathematical finance (Vasicek and CIR) and Machine Learning (Bagging and LSTM). The primary goal is to assess the forecasting performance relative to a Random Walk benchmark across different time horizons: 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.

## Overview
Interest rate forecasting plays a pivotal role in financial analysis. This project delves into the realm of interest rate prediction, exploring and evaluating various models. The models employed include mathematical finance models like Vasicek and CIR, as well as machine learning models such as Bagging and LSTM.
